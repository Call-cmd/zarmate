ZarMate: The WhatsApp Stablecoin Wallet






ZarMate is a full-stack financial technology platform that turns WhatsApp into a seamless ZAR stablecoin wallet. Designed for campus communities, it allows students and merchants to transact, earn rewards, and manage funds without ever needing to download a separate application.

This project was built for the Build ZAR Stablecoin Payment Apps on Lisk Hackathon and demonstrates a professional, decoupled architecture with a secure backend, a dynamic frontend, and real-time WhatsApp integration.

üß† Challenges & Learnings


This project was a deep dive into real-world engineering challenges, particularly when integrating with a new and sometimes unpredictable external API.


- Debugging External Services: A significant challenge was diagnosing performance issues with the hackathon's API, which initially caused timeouts. This required methodical testing, detailed logging, and clear communication with the API providers to isolate the bottleneck. It was a valuable lesson in building resilient systems that can handle external dependencies.
- API Discrepancies: We discovered several instances where the API's real-world behavior (e.g., nested response objects, case-sensitive IDs) differed from its documentation. This reinforced the importance of defensive coding and logging real API responses to adapt to the "source of truth."
- Architecting for Resilience: Our decision to build a decoupled backend for handling slow, asynchronous jobs proved to be the correct one. It completely insulated our frontend from the backend's performance issues, a key principle for building robust applications.
This project was an incredible learning experience in full-stack development, database management, and the art of debugging complex, distributed systems.
